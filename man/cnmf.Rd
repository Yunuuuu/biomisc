\title{Consensus Non-negative Matrix factorization}
\usage{
cnmf(
  matrix,
  rank,
  n_iters = 100L,
  rho = 0.3,
  min_dist = 0.03,
  min_fraction = 0.002,
  silhouette = TRUE,
  ...,
  cores = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A matrix with row is features and column is samples.}

\item{rank}{Specification of the factorization rank.}

\item{n_iters}{The number of times to run NMF internally before making the
consensus}

\item{rho}{Determines number of neighbors to use for calculating KNN distance
as rho * n_iters. can be thought of the fraction of replicates that must
yield a component approximately matching a program in order for that program
to be kept by cNMF.}

\item{min_dist}{distance threshold that determines how close a component must
be to its nearest neighbors in Euclidean space to be considered
‘approximately matching’.}

\item{min_fraction}{Only featuers with value (above 0) in at least
\code{min_fraction} of samples are used in cNMF.}

\item{silhouette}{If TRUE, will calculate silhouette score.}

\item{...}{

  }}

\item{cores}{Parallelization is applied with OpenMP using the number of
threads; \code{0} corresponds to all threads.}
}
\value{
A list.

\description{
A modified version of the cNMF algorithm, implemented in R
