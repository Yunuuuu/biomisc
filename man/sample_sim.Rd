\title{Sample features with similar expression level}
\usage{
sample_sim(matrix, features, size = 10^3L, nbin = 25L)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Normalized gene expression matrix with row is genes and column
is samples.}

\item{features}{The template for gene sampling, considering genes with
comparable expression levels of these genes.}

\item{size}{A non-negative integer giving the number of sampling.}

\item{nbin}{Divides the dataset into approximately \code{nbin} clusters based on
gene expression levels. Subsequently, the sampling process will be applied
within each cluster for the specified features.}
}
\value{
A list of character for each sampled genes.
}
