#' Overdispersion significance analysis for geneset
#' 
#' Principal component analysis was performed on the expression of the specified
#' geneset (`features`), and the variance explained by principal component (PC)1
#' was calculated. For each module, 1,000 random lists of genes with similar
#' expression levels were generated, and the variance explained by PC1 in those
#' genesets was calculated. The significance (p) was calculated as the fraction
#' of random genesets that resulted in a higher PC1 variance than the geneset
#' itself.
